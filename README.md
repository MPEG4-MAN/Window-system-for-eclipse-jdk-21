# Window-system-for-eclipse-jdk-21
This Eclipse project is designed so that when you load and run it, a window will open immediately.
You can use this project as a starting point for your own games or projects without having to write window code from scratch.
Itâ€™s completely free, and you can modify it to suit your needs.

Features included: creating a window, setting a window title, adding a custom window icon, and toggling fullscreen mode with Alt + Enter.
Note: This project does not include a 3D system. It currently works in 2D, but you can add libraries and additional code to implement 3D functionality.
